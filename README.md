Cartify: End-to-End Data Management & Analytics Platform

This project was developed as part of the Data Management module at Warwick Business School (MSc Business Analytics, 2024–2025). It simulates the design and deployment of a comprehensive data product for Cartify, a hypothetical e-commerce platform aiming to improve customer engagement and marketing efficiency through data-driven decision making.

# Business Understanding & Objective Definition:
Identified Cartify’s core challenge—high churn and lack of marketing insight—leading to the need for structured data analysis to improve campaign effectiveness and customer retention.

## Relational Database Design:
Constructed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implemented a normalized schema in SQLite, including constraints, foreign keys, cascading rules, and composite keys.

## Synthetic Data Generation:
Used Python, Faker, and Generative AI to create realistic datasets:
700+ customer records with UK-specific details
20,000+ products across 11 categories
2,000+ orders and associated order details
Campaigns, discounts, website activity, reviews, and geo-segmentation data

## SQL-Based Business Reporting:
Executed complex SQL queries using Pandas and SQLite to extract business insights such as:
Customer retention and order abandonment rates
Campaign ROI and cost-per-click
Sales trends, revenue distribution by city, discount effectiveness, and category profitability

## Insight Communication:
Developed a 2000-word report and a 10-minute executive-style presentation covering database structure, key findings, and strategic recommendations.

# Technologies Used
Python (Faker, pandas, requests)
SQLite (SQL DDL and DML)
ER Design (Crow's Foot Notation)
Jupyter Notebook
Git for version control

# Key Outcomes
Achieved a 78% customer retention rate through data-informed campaign strategies
Identified that 45% of users abandon carts, prompting UX improvement recommendations
Quantified a 6.83% average ROI on marketing campaigns
